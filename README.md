# SOTE-Data-Analysis
Every semester, SJSU students complete a Survey Of Teaching Effectiveness (SOTE), where they evaluate instructor effectiveness. I explore whether outside factors (such as grades or course subject) influence SJSU instructor evaluations, using categorical data analysis and a logistic regression model.

Please note: for privacy concerns, the actual data cannot be uploaded to GitHub at this time.
